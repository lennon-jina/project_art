This was also a retreat from personal and professional pressures. His wife, Camille, had died three years earlier, and Monet had entered into a domestic arrangement with Alice Hosched\u00e9 (whom he would marry in 1892, after her husband's death). France was in the midst of a lengthy economic recession that affected Monet's sales. In addition, the artist was unenthusiastic about the upcoming seventh Impressionist exhibition\u2014divisions within the group had become pronounced by this time\u2014and he delegated the responsibility for his contribution to his dealer, Paul Durand-Ruel.<\/p>\n<p>Disappointed in the area around the harbor city of Dieppe, which he found too urban, Monet settled in Pourville and remained in this fishing village until mid-April. He became increasingly enamored of his surroundings, writing to Hosched\u00e9 and her children: &quot;How beautiful the countryside is becoming, and what joy it would be for me to show you all its delightful nooks and crannies!&quot; He was able to do so in June, when they joined him in Pourville.The two young women strolling in <em>Cliff Walk at Pourville<\/em> are probably Marthe and Blanche, the eldest Hosched\u00e9 daughters.<\/p>\n<p>In this work, Monet addressed the problem of inserting figures into a landscape without disrupting the unity of its painterly surface. He integrated these elements with one another through texture and color. The grass\u2014composed of short, brisk, curved brushstrokes\u2014appears to quiver in the breeze, and subtly modified versions of the same strokes and hues suggest the women's wind-whipped dresses and shawls and the undulation of the sea. X-radiographs show that Monet reduced the rocky outcropping at the far right to balance the proportions of sea and sky.<\/p>\n","short_description":"In the 1880s, Monet went to paint in Normandy and became increasingly enamored of his surroundings.

These works replaced the varied contemporary subjects he had painted from the 1870s through the 1890s with a single, timeless motif\u2014water lilies. The focal point of these paintings was the artist\u2019s beloved \ufb02ower garden, which featured a water garden and a smaller pond spanned by a Japanese footbridge. In his first <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=NFPs_cRRGdM&feature=youtu.be\">water-lily series<\/a> (1897\u201399), Monet painted the pond environment, with its plants, bridge, and trees neatly divided by a fixed horizon. Over time, the artist became less and less concerned with conventional pictorial space. By the time he painted <em>Water Lilies<\/em>, which comes from his third group of these works, he had dispensed with the horizon line altogether. In this spatially ambiguous canvas, the artist looked down, focusing solely on the surface of the pond, with its cluster of vegetation \ufb02oating amid the re\ufb02ection of sky and trees. Monet thus created the image of a horizontal surface on a vertical one.<\/p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"89.9 \u00d7 94.1 cm (35 3\/8 \u00d7 37 1\/16 in.); Framed: 103.2 \u00d7 107 \u00d7 5.8 cm (40 5\/8 \u00d7 42 1\/8 \u00d7 2 1\/4 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth":null,"width":94,"height":89,"diameter":null,"clarification":null},{"depth":5,"width":107,"height":103,"diameter":null,"clarification":"Framed"}],"medium_display":"Oil on canvas","inscriptions":"Inscribed lower right: Claude Monet 1906","credit_line":"Mr. and Mrs. Martin A.

Gustave Caillebotte grew up near this district when it was a relatively unsettled hill with narrow, crooked streets. As part of a new city plan designed by Baron Georges-Eug\u00e8ne Haussmann, these streets were relaid and their buildings razed during the artist\u2019s lifetime. In this monumental urban view, which measures almost seven by ten feet and is considered the artist\u2019s masterpiece, Caillebotte strikingly captured a vast, stark modernity, complete with life-size figures strolling in the foreground and wearing the latest fashions. The painting\u2019s highly crafted surface, rigorous perspective, and grand scale pleased Parisian audiences accustomed to the academic aesthetic of the official Salon. On the other hand, its asymmetrical composition, unusually cropped forms, rain-washed mood, and candidly contemporary subject stimulated a more radical sensibility. For these reasons, the painting dominated the celebrated Impressionist exhibition of 1877, largely organized by the artist himself. In many ways, Caillebotte\u2019s frozen poetry of the Parisian bourgeoisie prefigures Georges Seurat\u2019s luminous <em>Sunday on La Grande Jatte\u20141884<\/em>, painted less than a decade later.<\/p>\n","short_description":"Considered Caillebotte\u2019s masterpiece, this view of a busy intersection captures both an everyday moment and all that was new in a rapidly changing Paris. The clothes are the latest fashion. The retractable umbrella was just invented. And a decades-long renovation had transformed the medieval streets of Paris into grand boulevards, like the ones seen here.
